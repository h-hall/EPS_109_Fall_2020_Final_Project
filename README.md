# EPS_109_Fall_2020_Final_Project
GitHub repo of data and code I used to complete my EPS 109 final project for UC Berkeley during the Fall of 2020. The project attempts to locate a lost high altitude balloon payload in the Mojave desert via a combination of Monte Carlo (MC) flight predictions to identify a likely landing location as well as analyzing Landsat 8 panchromatic RGB images over time.
